template.name: "Develop a Kubernetes app across hybrid cloud"
template.description: "With this toolchain, you can develop, and deploy a Kubernetes app securely across a hybrid cloud. By default, the toolchain uses a sample Node.js \"Hello World\" app, but you can link to your own git repository instead. This toolchain is preconfigured for continuous delivery with [Vulnerability Advisor](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2016/06/docker-container-security-with-vulnerability-advisor/), source control, issue tracking, online editing, and staging deployment to the IBM Cloud Kubernetes service and final production deployment to IBM Cloud Private.\n\n You can manage your Bluemix Container clusters in the [console](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers/cs_cluster.html#cs_cluster).\n\nThis toolchain uses tools that are part of the Continuous Delivery service. If an instance of that service isn't already in the selected resource group or organization, when you click **Create**, it is automatically added with the free [Lite](/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/) plan selected.\n\nTo get started, click **Create**.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, follow the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/tutorials/tc_secure_kube)."
template.gettingStarted: " **Your toolchain is ready!**\n**Quick start:** Commit a change to the Git repo to trigger a new Docker image build, which will be scanned for vulnerabilites and deployed in your Kubernetes cluster. For step-by-step instructions, see the [tutorial](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/tutorials/tc_secure_kube?task=2) for this toolchain."
